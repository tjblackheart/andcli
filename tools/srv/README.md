# otpsrv

This is a one file demo implementation of a registration application. It is meant as help to use when you want to implement a new vault and need some demo codes for that, without using a real world app.

`cd` into this directory and run the server with `go run ./...`, open a browser at [locahost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and create some users and tokens.

No data will be persisted.
